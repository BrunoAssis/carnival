Carnival is an easy-to-use and extensible Rails Engine to speed the development of data management interfaces.

When you use Carnival you can benefit from made features that are already done. If you need to change anything, you can write your own version of the method, using real Ruby code without worrying about the syntax of the engine.

##Features

* Easy way to CRUD any data;
* Search data easily;
* Advanced Searches in a minute. You can specify which fields you want to search for;
* Fancy time filter, based on Toggl design;
* Authentication and CRUD of users based on Devise;
* Facebook and Google authentication;
* Nice default layout, ready to use.
* User notification engine.
* New and Edit forms are easily configured. If you do ot like, you can write your own views.

##Based of the Gems we are used to
* Devise for authentication;
* OmniAuth for Facebook and Google;
* Inherited Resources on our controllers;
* SimpleForm for new and edit forms;
* WickedPDF for PDF generation;

##How it works
In some words, Carnival provides a managing infra-structure for your application. All the data related to Carnival will be located under the /admin namespace.


## Getting started

Carnival works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your Gemfile with:

```ruby
gem 'carnival'
```

Run bundle install


Execute the command below to copy migrations and generate the initializer, after you install Carnival.

> rails generate carnival:install

## Usage

### Model

```ruby

module Admin
  class Company < ActiveRecord::Base

    include Carnival::ModelHelper
    self.table_name = "companies"

  end
end

```

### Controller

```ruby

module Admin
  class CompaniesController < Carnival::BaseAdminController
    layout "carnival/admin"

    def permitted_params
      params.permit(admin_company: [:name])
    end
  end
end

```

### Presenter

```ruby

module Admin
  class CompanyPresenter < Carnival::BaseAdminPresenter
    field :id,
          :actions => [:index, :show], :sortable => false,
          :searchable => true,
          :advanced_search => {:operator => :equal}
    field :name,
          :actions => [:index, :new, :edit, :show],
          :searchable => true,
          :advanced_search => {:operator => :like}
    field :created_at, :actions => [:index, :show]

    action :show
    action :edit
    action :destroy
    action :new

  end
end


```
