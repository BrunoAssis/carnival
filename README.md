Carnival is an easy-to-use and extensible Rails Engine to speed the development of data management interfaces.

When you use Carnival you can benefit from made features that are already done. If you need to change anything, you can write your own version of the method, using real Ruby code without worrying about the syntax of the engine.

##Features

* Easy way to CRUD any data;
* Search data easily;
* Advanced Searches in a minute. You can specify which fields you want to search for;
* Fancy time filter, based on Toggl design;
* Authentication and CRUD of users based on Devise;
* Facebook and Google authentication;
* Nice default layout, ready to use.
* User notification engine.
* New and Edit forms are easily configured. If you do ot like, you can write your own views.

##Based of the Gems we are used to
* Devise for authentication;
* OmniAuth for Facebook and Google;
* Inherited Resources on our controllers;
